## Veco Masternode Installation Script

This is a complete guide to setup a Masternode for Veco Coin.  This method uses a "cold" Windows wallet with a "hot" Ubuntu 16.04 Linux VPS.  The reason for this is so your coins will be safe in your Windows wallet offline and the VPS will host the Masternode but will not hold any coins.

## Requirements

1. Download the latest Veco Windows wallet [**here**](https://github.com/VecoOfficial/Veco/releases)
2. Exactly 1000 VECO coins sent to a new receiving address
3. Download and install Putty [**here**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) 


## Setting up the Masternode

- Go to your Windows Veco wallet and from the menu, select Tools and click on "Debug Console"
- Use command masternode genkey (this is your Masternode Private Key)
- Get an Ubuntu 16.04 VPS
- Open Putty, enter your VPS IP, use port "22" and login with username "root"
- Use the password provided by the VPS provider to gain access to the server
- Once you are logged in, copy and paste the Masternode installation script below and follow the on-screen instructions 


```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VecoOfficial/masternode-script-veco/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

## Error Troubleshooting
If for some reason you donâ€™t have Git installed, you can install git with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

If script doesn't start: 
- Check that you have write permission in the current folder
- Check that you can change permission on a file
